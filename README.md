# Interactive Profile Card using Motion UI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a simple, animated profile card built using **Motion UI**, a powerful library for creating CSS transitions and animations. The card is designed to slide into view when activated, with interactive elements and animated toggling of additional user details.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Sliding In Card**  
  The profile card remains hidden by default and slides in from the side using Motion UIâ€™s `slide-in-left` animation when a button is clicked.

- **Toggle Details**  
  Users can click a **"View Details"** button to reveal more information with a smooth `fade-in` animation.

- **Interactive Elements**  
  Hover effects on buttons and the profile picture â€” such as scale-up or subtle fade â€” enhance user interactivity.
